# AI-Powered Media Library Organizer - Production Architecture

## 🎯 Project Summary

A production-ready AI-powered media library organizer that leverages Google Gemini AI via the google-genai library to intelligently organize movie and TV show collections. The system analyzes directory structures, uses AI to suggest optimal organization plans, and safely applies changes to your filesystem with enterprise-grade safety features.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is built with a modular architecture consisting of:

1. **Directory Analysis** (`tree_generator.py`) - Scans and analyzes media directory structures
2. **AI Integration** (`ai_organizer.py`) - Communicates with Google Gemini via google-genai for organization suggestions
3. **File Operations** (`file_operations.py`) - Safely executes file system changes with backup support
4. **CLI Interface** (`main.py`) - User-friendly command-line interface
5. **Configuration** - Environment-based configuration with `.env` support

# Production setup with logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Enterprise-grade processing
generator = TreeGenerator("/path/to/shows")
organizer = AIOrganizer(api_key)
file_ops = FileOperations("/path/to/shows", 
                         dry_run=False, 
                         backup_enabled=True)

# Process with error handling
try:
    tree = generator.generate_single_folder_tree("Silicon Valley")
    plan = organizer.organize_tv_show(tree_text, "Silicon Valley")
    
    # Validate before execution
    valid_ops, errors = organizer.validate_suggestions(plan, base_path)
    if errors:
        logging.error(f"Validation errors: {errors}")
        return
    
    # Execute with full reporting
    report = file_ops.execute_plan(plan)
    logging.info(f"Processed {report.successful_operations} operations")
    
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"Processing failed: {e}")
    file_ops.undo_last_operation()  # Auto-recovery
```
